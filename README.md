# Speed-typer

Typing games are a great way to make learning to type easier and more fun.
Games discourage you from looking at the keyboard while encouraging you to
spend more time practicing and improving your **typing skills**.

* Every time you write correct word time increment 2 sec
* There are three levels of difficulty
    * Easy
    * Medium
    * Hard
